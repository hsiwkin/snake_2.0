# Snake game

## TODO:
- [x] colors: FoodClass has color A, 
      when snake eats it a box colored with A should be added to its body
- [ ] block generating the same position for food two times in a row
- [ ] input processing fixes: 
  - [ ] it should not be possible to change a direction of a snake to an opposing one
  - [ ] queue direction commands (sometimes, when I change it fast some of them are lost)
- [ ] add gif to README
- [ ] connect it with heroku, add auto-deployment
- [ ] Refactor GameObject (snake does not need to have color info in it, food does)
